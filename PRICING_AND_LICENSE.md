# Pricing Strategy & Licensing Guidance — VUA TOTALITY

Purpose
Provide pricing tiers and licensing recommendations for distributing and supporting VUA TOTALITY.

Suggested Licensing Options
1) Open-source with paid services (recommended for adoption)
- License: MIT or BSD-3-Clause for code permissiveness.
- Offer paid support, hardened builds, and commercial licenses for enterprises.

2) Dual-license model
- Offer code under an open-source license (AGPL or MIT) and commercial license for closed-source internal use.
- Useful if you want to retain stronger commercial control.

3) Proprietary license
- Keep project closed-source and sell licenses. Higher revenue but slower adoption.

Recommended: MIT + Paid Support / Commercial License Offer
- MIT encourages adoption.
- Provide `commercial-support` agreements and paid add-ons (SLA, managed hosting, attestation archival).
