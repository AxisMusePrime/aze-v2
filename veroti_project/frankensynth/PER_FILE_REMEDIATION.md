## docker-compose.yml

Findings summary: {'BTC_BECH32': 1, 'API_KEY_LIKE': 1}

Notes:

- Contains a BTC bech32 address in plaintext. This may be test data or a real address.

Recommended actions (choose after confirming scope):

- If this address is tied to a private key stored in this repository or elsewhere in your systems, treat it as compromised: rotate wallets/keys immediately and transfer funds to a new address.
- If the address is only informational/public, consider replacing it with a placeholder (e.g., "bc1...REDACTED") or moving it to an offline document.
- If you want to remove all historical occurrences, create a redacted replacement commit and then use `git filter-repo --path docker-compose.yml --invert-paths` or a targeted removal rule (I can prepare exact commands).


## run_entylion_conduit.py

Findings summary: {'BTC_BECH32': 1, 'API_KEY_LIKE': 1}

Notes:

- Contains the same BTC bech32 address as found in `docker-compose.yml`.

Recommended actions:

- Inspect the surrounding code to determine whether a private key, seed, or wallet file is referenced or embedded. If a private key or seed phrase exists in this repo, rotate immediately.
- Replace exposed addresses or tokens with placeholders or environment-config references (do not store secrets in source files).
- To expunge historical values, create a redacted commit and use git-filter-repo as described in the cleanup guide.


## veroti-project/docker-compose.yml

Findings summary: {'BTC_BECH32': 1, 'API_KEY_LIKE': 1}

Notes:

- Duplicate of the BTC address appearing in project subfolder; likely shared/test config across components.

Recommended actions:

- Same remediation as other docker-compose occurrences: replace with placeholder, and if needed, remove history after creating a redacted replacement.


## frankensynth/codex_manifest_safe.py

Findings summary: {'EMAIL': 1}

Notes:

- Contains `[REDACTED EMAIL]` in plaintext. This appears to be a contact email included in generated synthesis code.

Recommended actions:

- Replace personal email with a project contact placeholder or move to a config file excluded from git (e.g., a `.env` or an untracked `config.local`).
- If you prefer to keep an email in code, consider using a role/account address (e.g., `security@example.com`) instead of a personal address.
